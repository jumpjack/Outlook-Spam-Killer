# Outlook Spam Killer
The ultimate method to kill spam message: you select a spammer address once, it will be removed for ever

A VBA Macro which allows manually marking (once for all) a sender address or name as "spamr" or "notification", saving to local .txt file; then, at a click of a button, all messages of a folder (or just the selected ones) will be automatically moved to "spam" or "notification" folder. Nothin is deleted, just moved.
